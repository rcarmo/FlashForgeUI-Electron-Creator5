## Project Overview

FlashForgeUI is an Electron-based desktop and headless controller for FlashForge printers. It supports multi-context printing, material station workflows, Spoolman-powered filament tracking, go2rtc-based camera streaming (WebRTC/MSE), Discord + desktop notifications, and a fully authenticated WebUI. The app runs on Windows/macOS/Linux with both GUI and headless entry points (headless automatically boots the WebUI server).

## Development Workflow Expectations

- **Invoke the `best-practices` skill** for universal software engineering principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, etc.) and the `electron` skill for Electron-specific guidance. These skills provide authoritative best practices.

- **Gather context efficiently**: Prefer `code-search-mcp` tools for fast, comprehensive codebase searching (see [TOOLING.md](ai_docs/TOOLING.md)). For simple queries, use `Grep` or `Glob` built-in tools.

- **Package Manager**: This project uses **pnpm** (not npm or yarn). Use `pnpm install`, `pnpm add`, `pnpm <script>`, or `pnpm run <script>` for all package operations.

- **Windows Python**: On this Windows development environment, always use `python` not `python3` when running Python scripts or skills.

- **Plan before coding**: create a multi-step plan (skip only for trivial edits) and keep it updated as you complete steps.

- **Editing**: prefer `Edit` tool for targeted changes, keep diffs minimal, and never revert user-owned changes. Maintain ASCII unless the file already uses Unicode.

- **Documentation**: every repo-maintained `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, and `.cjs` source file should begin with an `@fileoverview` block describing purpose, key exports, and relationships. Use `pnpm docs:check` to catch gaps under `src/` and `pnpm docs:combine` to refresh `fileoverview-report.md`.

- **Testing workflow**: `pnpm test` runs Jest over `src/`, `pnpm test:e2e` runs browser Playwright against the built WebUI fixture server, and `pnpm test:e2e:electron*` covers desktop Playwright flows. `test:all` currently excludes the Electron suites, so run the Electron slice explicitly when desktop behavior changes.

- **Validation**: run the smallest meaningful checks (`pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, targeted scripts) before handing work back. Reserve `pnpm build*` for user requests or when architectural changes demand it.

- **Completion Checklist** (from [TOOLING.md](ai_docs/TOOLING.md)):
  1. Run type checking, if there's errors iterate until they are fixed properly (no band-aids, etc)
  2. Once type checking passes, run build. This ensures electron-vite compiles both main and renderer processes without errors, and if there are any, iterate until they are fixed properly (no band-aids, etc)
  3. Once build passes, the final check is running lint. It's important to never ignore the errors, the more they pile up the harder it becomes to do cleanups/maintain the codebase.

  Do not say you are done with something despite not having run one/any of these checks, and the same if one fails. All must be run and pass to ensure codebase quality and production readiness.

## Recent Lessons

1. Component dialog preloads must import typings with `import type {} from '../../types/global';` - runtime `.d.ts` imports break the dialog bootstrap.

2. The component dialog expects untouched `polling-update` payloads; do not transform the shape before forwarding to `ComponentManager.updateAll`.

3. GridStack initialization (`src/ui/gridstack/`) already registers and wires widgets (for example, the log panel). Removing or duplicating that flow leaves globals unset.

4. Spoolman integration deliberately blocks AD5X/material-station contexts (`src/services/SpoolmanIntegrationService.ts`). Removing the guard regresses filament safety checks.

5. **Camera streaming**: `Go2rtcService` provides unified streaming via go2rtc (WebRTC/MSE). `Go2rtcBinaryManager` handles binary lifecycle and configuration handoff. Do not manually configure go2rtc streams outside that service stack.

6. Headless mode and desktop mode share the same connection/polling/camera stack. Avoid `isHeadlessMode()` forks unless absolutely necessary; duplicating logic leads to drift.

7. **Theme System**: NEVER hardcode colors in CSS. Always use CSS variables from the theme system (`--theme-primary`, `--theme-primary-hover`, `--surface-elevated`, etc.). The theme system handles light/dark themes automatically. See [THEME_SYSTEM.md](ai_docs/THEME_SYSTEM.md).

8. **Per-printer settings access**: `PrinterDetailsManager` does NOT have a `getSettings()` method. Per-printer settings (like `showCameraFps`, `customCameraUrl`, `rtspFrameRate`, etc.) are stored directly on `PrinterDetails`. Access them via `context.printerDetails.showCameraFps` rather than inventing manager methods. See `src/shared/types/printer.ts` for the full `PrinterDetails` interface.

9. **Release versioning**: Semver treats stable versions as newer than prereleases with the same base (`1.0.3 > 1.0.3-alpha.X`). After releasing a stable version, the next alpha MUST bump the version number. Correct flow:
   ```
   1.0.3-alpha.1 -> 1.0.3-alpha.2 -> 1.0.3 (stable)
                                  |
   1.0.4-alpha.1 -> 1.0.4-alpha.2 -> 1.0.4 (stable)
   ```
   Never continue `X.Y.Z-alpha.N` after releasing `X.Y.Z` stable - `electron-updater` will look for `alpha.yml` in the stable release (which doesn't have it) and 404.

10. **Legacy mode is per-printer**: backend selection must read the saved printer/context setting instead of any global `ForceLegacyAPI` override. If a 5M-series printer needs legacy behavior, seed or update that printer's own settings rather than adding a process-wide fallback.

11. **Discovery alignment**: the desktop discovery path now follows the updated `@ghosttypes/ff-api` discovery API. If printers connect but tab state or discovery rows look wrong, inspect `src/main/index.ts`, `PrinterDiscoveryService.ts`, and renderer tab updates together instead of patching only one layer.

12. **WebUI cache regressions**: built WebUI assets must remain version-stamped and served with no-cache headers. The browser Playwright suite exists specifically to catch stale asset mixes, icon hydration mismatches, and camera bootstrap regressions before release.

13. **Desktop E2E boundaries**: use `tests/e2e/electron/desktop-smoke.spec.ts` for live `%APPDATA%` smoke coverage and `tests/e2e/electron/desktop-emulator.spec.ts` for isolated emulator-backed lifecycle coverage. On Windows, prefer the dedicated `package.json` scripts over ad hoc Playwright grep invocations.

## Key File Locations

### Bootstrapping & Entry

- `src/main/bootstrap.ts` - sets app name/userData path before anything else loads
- `src/main/index.ts` - main-process orchestrator (imports bootstrap first, registers IPC, creates windows)
- `src/preload/index.ts` / `src/renderer/src/ui/component-dialog/component-dialog-preload.ts` - context bridges for main + dialog renderers

### Managers & Multi-Context Core

- `src/main/managers/PrinterContextManager.ts`, `PrinterBackendManager.ts`, `ConnectionFlowManager.ts`, `PrinterDetailsManager.ts`, `HeadlessManager.ts`, `LoadingManager.ts`
- `src/main/services/MultiContextPollingCoordinator.ts`, `MultiContextPrintStateMonitor.ts`, `MultiContextTemperatureMonitor.ts`, `MultiContextSpoolmanTracker.ts`, `MultiContextNotificationCoordinator.ts`
- `src/main/services/MainProcessPollingCoordinator.ts`, `PrinterPollingService.ts` for legacy single-printer paths

### Backends & Printers

- `src/main/printer-backends/*.ts` - Legacy, Adventurer5M, Adventurer5M Pro, AD5X implementations
- `src/main/printer-backends/ad5x/*` - material station transforms/types/utils

### Model Detection (TCP-First Bootstrap, PID-Aware)

- **Bootstrap order matters.** The HTTP `/detail` endpoint requires authentication (`serialNumber` + `checkCode`), so during the very first connection — before the user has supplied a check code — we cannot read the firmware-set `pid` from `/detail`. `ConnectionEstablishmentService.ts` therefore opens an unauthenticated TCP `M115` first via `tcpClient.getPrinterInfo()` and uses the resulting `TypeName` (firmware-controlled, e.g. `"FlashForge Adventurer 5M Pro"`) for backend selection in `PrinterUtils.ts` (`detectPrinterModelType` / `detectPrinterFamily`). This is correct and intentional — `TypeName` is firmware-set and not the same as the user-mutable `Name` from `/detail`.
- **Once paired, trust the library.** After the check code is provided and `FiveMClient.initialize()` succeeds, `client.isPro` / `client.isAD5X` / `info.Pid` (from `@ghosttypes/ff-api>=1.3.1`) are derived from the firmware `pid` (35 = 5M, 36 = 5M Pro, 38 = AD5X). All later capability gating should read those flags, not re-substring-match `info.Name` — that field is user-mutable via the LCD or cloud and re-deriving capabilities from it re-introduces the bug fixed in `ff-5mp-hass#13`.
- **Don't mutate `client.isAD5X` after the fact.** If the upstream library disagrees with what you expected, fix the library or the backend selection upstream — don't patch the flag locally.
